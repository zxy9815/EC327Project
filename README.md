# Instructions to compile and run the project

In order to run the app, you can import the whole project to Android Studio and run in virtual devices.

Or you can download app-release.apk and import it to Android Studio.

Compiler may warn that Configuration 'compile' is obsolete and has been replaced with 'implementation' and 'api'.
This will not affect testing and running our app.
